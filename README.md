# Problem Statement

## Project Description -
The aim of the project is to create a dictionary application using Angular. You will be
using Oxford dictionary’s open API as your backend and the frontend application that is
to be created by you must have all the features mentioned later. Application UI should
be designed by yourself using Bootstrap. You are not allowed to use bootstrap
template available on internet. The code should be entirely yours.
Before we jump into the feature list, let's look at our API and how to use it.
## About the API -
Oxford Dictionaries API is an open source dictionary API which gives you access to all
the data that is used by oxford dictionary website. Here is how you can use the API -
Step 1 - Go to https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com and click on Get your API Key.
Step 2 - Select the Free plan which gives you access to 3k requests per month. We
think that many requests should be sufficient for your overall project development,
however if you discover that you need more, just create another free account using a
different email id. Do not select a paid pricing plan!
Step 3 - Once you have signed up. Get your APP key and ID
Step 4 - Check out this guide on how to make request to this API
Step 5 - Follow this API Documentation to select the suitable API for your application
feature
## Features of the Application -
1) Search page - The home page of the application should be a search page with
option to search a particular word in the dictionary. The search box should show
suggestions only after first 3 characters have been typed in the search box. The
search box should also show autocomplete suggestions while typing the words in
the search box. Take example from the search box on the home page of oxford
dictionary . You have to create a custom component of your own for this ( do not
use an external NPM module or library for this) . There should be a search
button to enable user to search the word. On clicking search or on clicking the
word on the autocomplete list, a full page view of that word should open
2) Full page view of the word - On clicking the word in autocomplete list or
pressing search button in previous view, a full page view of the word should
open. It should display all the information about that word. Take example from
this word page of oxford dictionary where the word “something” has been
searched. As displayed on the page, your view should display all meanings, use
of the word in phrases etc. It should also display the synonyms and antonyms of
the words(if any). Select the relevant API from the API documentation yourself.
3) Error Views - Check out the HTTP response codes for this API. You have to
handle each error response with a different page.


# Project Description :
   The front end of the application is built with angular and it is hosted in the **AWS EC2** Instance. mdbootstrap is used for page creating layouts. 
  
   The application has 2 main views. 

 - Home view
 -  Definition view

 The home view is the app shell. The search input is a separate component as it is used in both the views. 

  The Application uses 3 different API endpoints to get data. One for getting the search suggestions as user types and others are to retrieve the full data of a word and synonyms, antonyms respectively.

   The search input component uses rxjs operators *debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, switchMap, filter* to prevent unnecessary API requests to the server.

 - Listen for data from an input.

- Trim the value (remove whitespace) and make sure it’s a minimum length (3).
- Debounce (so as not to send off API requests for every keystroke, but instead wait for a break in keystrokes).
- Don’t send a request if the value stays the same (rapidly hit a character, then backspace, for instance).
- Cancel ongoing AJAX requests if their results will be invalidated by the updated results.

  
The ngx-progressbar and ngx-toaster external libraries to enhance the user experience. The toaster is used to notify the user about the successful and unsuccessful API requests and ngx-progressbar is used to show the visualization of HTTP requests.

   As the user types in the search box, the suggestions are displayed after clicking any of those suggestions the definition view is opened which contains origin, synonyms & antonyms (If available) and meaning with examples.

The data in the definition view is separated based on the grammatical type and each has the option for the user to hear the pronunciation of the word.

   The Application has the manifest.json which turns it to a PWA (Progressive Web App). The service workers are included for offline usage of the application and asset caching. (service workers only work in production build)
    The API does not currently support CORS requests due to the potential implications for the security of their server the application uses the proxy server to get the response from the API. Check out here 
(https://forum.oxforddictionaries.com/api/discussion/18/error-message-no-access-control-allow-origin-or-i-can-t-get-my-client-side-request-to-work).

### P.S:
The Development version is hosted in AWS and served with the webpack-dev-server, which is used in development. The nginx is configured to redirect all requests for the domain https://lexicon.vivekm.me to the localhost:4200 using proxy_pass as the API does not support CORS requests and client-side requests. The development server is added as the background process in the server using the forever npm package.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
